# Analyze Death Age Difference of Right Handers with Left Handers (Python Pandas Matplotlib)

**Introduction -**
In 1991, a study reported that left-handed individuals die, on average, nine years earlier than their right-handed counterparts. This project investigates the validity of this claim by analyzing age distribution data, focusing on whether the observed difference in average age at death can be attributed to changing rates of left-handedness over time.

**Objectives -**

**1. Primary Goal:** 
Examine if there is a significant difference in the average age at death between left-handed and right-handed individuals.

**2.Broader Impact:** 
Understand the implications of handedness on human health and longevity.

**3. Data Analysis Skills Applied:**

1. pandas Foundations: Data manipulation and analysis.
2. Statistical Thinking in Python: Hypothesis testing and statistical analysis.
3. Introduction to Data Visualization with Python: Creating insightful visualizations.
4. Foundations of Probability in Python: Constructing probabilities and applying Bayes' theorem.
5. Fundamentals of Bayesian Data Analysis in Python: Advanced statistical modeling.
